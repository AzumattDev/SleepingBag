Allows you to set your spawn point with less requirements than a bed, and to sleep under the stars if you are lucky with the weather.

```
Must be installed on all clients and the server if you want to sync the configurations.

Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.

This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server, it will sync all configs to client

This mod uses a file watcher. 
If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file
save, it will sync the changes to all clients.

First, I would like to shout out the original creator of the mod and the assets. Though the assets are free on Unity store, they still deserve a shout out for making the code and tweaking the assets.
This mod was remade by request since the original mod was not updated for a long time. The original mod allowed using the assets and code freely. Find the original mod [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/1334).

> ## Installation Instructions
***You must have BepInEx installed correctly! I can not stress this enough.***
`Only required to be installed on the server.`

1. Download the latest version of BepInEx from [here](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Make sure it's installed correctly on the server and your/all clients.
3. Put the DLL into your BepInEx\plugins folder on the server and your/all clients.
4. Launch the server/client. 
5. Change the settings to your liking found in the configuration file generated in `BepInEx/config` called `Azumatt.SleepingBag.cfg` to the desired configurations. Only needed to change on the server if installed there, it will sync to all clients.
6. You should now be good to go. Though, I do recommend that you change the configurations from in game using the [BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/). It's a lot easier to use.
